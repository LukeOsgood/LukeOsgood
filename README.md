## 🎓 Education  
### **University of Denver, Daniels College of Business**  
📚 **Bachelor of Science in Business Administration** – Business Information and Analytics (June 2026)  

I plan on taking advantage of the [4+1 program](https://daniels.du.edu/undergraduate-programs/four-plus-one/) here at the University of Denver, getting my master’s degree in Management in the coming years!

### Relevant Coursework  
A recent class that I took at the University of Denver called **Information of Information Management (INFO 3140)**, taught me how to code in **SQL** and navigate **Microsoft Access**.

In this class, I created a fictional company and uploaded a mass amount of randomly generated data. I then created a **Microsoft Access database**, drawing important connections from each data table with the correct relationships. I answered important business questions such as **which customers purchased the most products** or **what equipment costs were greater than $200?** I organized all this in an extremely visually pleasing way.

📊 **Example of Access Database:**

Overall, I learned many important analytic technical skills, as well as a greater understanding in **business databases**.

## 🏆 Projects  
### **Madden Challenge**  
In the fall of 2022, me and a group of four other like-minded individuals embarked on a journey with a goal of creating a product utilizing **artificial intelligence and IoT (Internet of Things)** such as **augmented reality, blockchain technology, etc.**

My group introduced a wellness ring called **“Ping”** that optimized productivity and sleep routines through tailored suggestions received from an application on a mobile device. My main roles as a team member were to:
- Provide overarching conceptual ideas  
- Create a **website promoting the product**  
- **Settle team disputes**  

Throughout our experience, we encountered many speed bumps, such as **website domain issues, Bluetooth capability, and application UI/UX**. We navigated these challenges by **communicating as a team, conferring with supervisors, and learning coding practices**.
